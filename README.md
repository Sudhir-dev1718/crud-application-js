This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It is designed for beginners who want to understand how data manipulation works on the client side without using any backend.


Features

⦁	Add new records
⦁	Display data dynamically
⦁	Edit existing records
⦁	Delete records
⦁	Stores data using LocalStorage
⦁	Clean and beginner-friendly code


Folder Structure

crud-application-js/
│── index.html
│── style.css
│── script.js
└── assets/ (if any)

 How It Works

1. User enters information in a form  
2. Data is stored in **JavaScript arrays / LocalStorage**  
3. DOM is updated dynamically to show the changes  
4. User can edit or delete any record  



 Technologies Used

⦁	HTML5 – Page structure  
⦁	CSS3 – Styling  
⦁	JavaScript (ES6) – CRUD logic and DOM manipulation
⦁	LocalStorage – Saving data permanently
